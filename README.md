Using LSTM to predict the market. 

The goal is not to predict singular prices but the derivative or price 30 days or a month in the future. 
LSTM has proven to be the best regression algorithm to do this. 
I might change to classification algorithms and use {Price up in 30 days = true or false}. 
That could end up being better...
